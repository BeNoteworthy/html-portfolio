<h1>Best Movies According to Krishana</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Sound of Music</h3>
<p>I grew up watching this movie whenever it came on TV. I especially loved the songs, which are classics, as well as the scenery in the movie.</p>
<h3>Mr. Holland's Opus</h3>
<p>I'm sure you see a theme here! I love music in movies!</p>
<h3>Cinderella</h3>
<p>Going back to my childhood, the version with Brandy, Whitney Houston, Paolo Montalban, Bernadette Peters and more, really resonated with me. Once again, the songs were always a draw for me.</p>
